## Summary of experimental codes for all different scenarios and settings.

+ **Large-Scale Scenario**: The experimental code for some settings of RQ2 in this article is in the [large_scale_scenario](./large_scale_scenario) file. Please refer to the [README.md](./large_scale_scenario/README.md) in the folder for related experiments.

+ **Small-Scale Scenario**: The experimental code for some settings of RQ1 and RQ2 in this article is in the [small_scale_scenario](./small_scale_scenario) file. Please refer to the [README.md](./small_scale_scenario/README.md) in the folder for related experiments.

+ **OOD Learning Setting**: The experimental code for the first part of the scenario of RQ3 in this article is in the [ood_learning_setting](./ood_learning_setting) file. Please refer to the [README.md](./ood_learning_setting/README.md) in the folder for related experiments.

+ **Continual Learning Setting**: The experimental code for the second part of the scenario of RQ3 in this article is in the [continual_learning_setting](./continual_learning_setting) file. Please refer to the [README.md](./continual_learning_setting/README.md) in the folder for related experiments.

## Summary of official Code.

+ We will also provide a cleaner and easier-to-use official code repository after notification.
